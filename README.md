The task is to use a mixture of C code and ARM assembly to build a simple game that will teach a player Morse Code. The player should interact with the game by pressing the GP21 button on the MAKER-PI-PICO board for a short duration to input a Morse “dot” and a longer duration to input a Morse “dash”. If no new input is entered for at least 1 second after one-or-more “dots” or “dashes” have been input, then it should be considered a “space” character. If no new input is entered for at least another 1 second after that, then the sequence should be considered compete and passed to the game portion of the code for pattern matching. The game should have a minimum of two levels. The first level for matching individual characters (with the expected Morse pattern provided) and the second for matching individual characters (without the expected Morse pattern provided).
